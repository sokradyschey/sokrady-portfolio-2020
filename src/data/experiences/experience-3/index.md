As the Quality Assurance Engineer I help the Engineering teams stay focused on product scheduling, testing new features, and find bugs in the products. I focus on manual testing while gradually implementing automated testing for future features. Within the first 3 months of starting at STRATIS IoT, I reported over 100 bugs that involved suggestions for the User’s Experience flow and product implementation overall. My attention to detail has helped the Engineering team stay focused on implementing features and fixing the bugs that can potentially harm important pieces of STRATIS’ products.
