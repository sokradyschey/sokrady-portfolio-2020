I collaborate with project managers and UX designers to ensure projects are built in a timely manner and expected quality for the clients. Recently, I built a responsive website for a non-profit organization that provides support for victims of domestic violence. The site is on a custom WordPress theme, thoughtfully implementing HTML and CSS to build the foundation of the site. I included interactive features using jQuery such as searchable hotline support services and an elegant events calendar that allows registering for the event and calendar updates. I ensured the site is accurately integrated in PHP and cross-browser tested. With the help of project managers clarifying timelines and other engineers for QA, I managed to accurately and efficiently build the project as depicted from the designs and launched without delays.
